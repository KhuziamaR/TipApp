# Pre-work - *Tip App*

**Tip App** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Khuziama Rehman**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I can improve this application by making the UI more aesthetic.
- [ ] Making the app have different feautures such as a new keyboard layout instead of the decimal keyboard will make it more visually appealing.

## Notes

A few Challenges I had while making this application was getting certain styles to work. Getting the application to function was fairly simple, however, once I added some styling and tried to make the app more aesthetic, i was getting unknown errors and it was difficult for me to debugg the code as it is my first time using both xcode and swift. The error i was getting was "Cant find keyplane that supports type 8 for keyboard".
